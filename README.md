# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection

### What is Diabetic Retinopathy?

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes mellitus that leads to retinal lesions, impairing vision. If not detected early, it can ultimately result in blindness. Unfortunately, DR is an irreversible condition; available treatments can only prevent further vision loss. However, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in reducing the risk of vision impairment.

The manual diagnosis of DR through retina fundus images by ophthalmologists is often time-consuming, costly, and prone to misdiagnosis. In contrast, computer-aided diagnosis systems can offer faster and more reliable results.

### Our Project

In this project, we will be developing a **Transfer Learning model** capable of detecting and classifying various types of Diabetic Retinopathy. The model will be integrated into a web application where users can upload Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) images, such as Mild DR, Severe DR, etc., and receive the analyzed results via an intuitive User Interface.
